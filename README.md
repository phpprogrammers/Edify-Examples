==============

The following package is the Kitchen Sink of example code based on the 'Edify
Library' the library is an Open source project that is linked to the Edify
project on Git-hub https://github.com/phpprogrammers/Edify the Library is not
a Framework but rather a way of letting you have additional functionality
available as a developer.

You can use the code in anyway you want to make life easier we have included a
basic auto loader to automatically include class files for you.  You can even
add additional Vendors so that the Auto include will work for them if they
support the standards.
